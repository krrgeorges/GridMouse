### GridMouse

GridMouse is a utility for accessing mouse actions through keyboard. It works by using mode toggle.

There are two modes available for switching between normal keyboard use(NormalControl Mode) and using keyboard for mouse actions(MouseControl Mode), toggled by Alt+X.

The monitor is divided into 3x3 grid.
